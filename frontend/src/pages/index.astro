          Statistical Analysis and Exploration of Generative AI in Graphic
          Memoirs
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting and rapidly evolving
          field, but its impact on literature has yet to be fully explored.
          According to Anantrasirichai and Bull's "Artificial Intelligence in
          the Creative Industries: a Review," artificial intelligence is
          described as an algorithmic process which allows "a computer system to
          develop and emulate human-like behavior and hence make decisions
          similar to (or in some cases, better than) humans" (591). A large
          branch of AI is machine learning (ML) which "employs computational
          methods to 'learn' information directly from large amounts of example
          data without relying on a predetermined equation or model" (591).
          Among the most recent developments in artificial intelligence is
          generative AI which utilizes algorithms to very accurately create or
          generate text and image content. In the first part of my research I
          will analyze the means in which Marjane Satrapi promotes political and
          social activism in her graphic memoir, <i>The Complete Persepolis</i>,
          by closely examining the text and image content (features) of her
          memoir utilizing machine learning techniques and generating aggregate
          statistics. I will then follow my analysis with a case study on the
          effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages of generative AI being
          used to create text and images to disseminate ideologies in the same
          way graphic memoirs like Satrapi's achieve. While there are previous
          papers describing the influence of Satrapi's work as a medium to
          promote political and social activism against Iran's strict Islamic
          regime (Stromberg 91-119), none follow a statistical and machine
          learning approach to automatically identify unique features in
          Satrapi's memoir for analysis. My work provides a baseline as well as
          an open-source tool for statistical methods in comparing different
          graphic memoirs.
        </p>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Methods</h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          There are numerous features of a graphic memoir that allow it to
          convey different messages. For instance, the average number of words
          per page can reveal much about an author's styleâ€”short versus long
          sentences can have different effects on readers. Additionally, the
          number of panels in a page allows certain authors to underscore a
          particular scene in their memoir. Using object recognition or shape
          detection algorithms, it may be possible to count the number of panels
          per page in a given graphic memoir. Also, there are currently
          sentiment analysis algorithms in place that allow computers to
          recognize the connotation of certain words and phrases with the
          capabilities of large language models (LLMs) which are algorithms that
          have the ability to effectively interpret and generate natural
          language. Looking at the ratio of positive, negative, and neutral
          sentiment words may reveal important information in that regard.
          Another important metric would be to consider the average ratio of
          words to images in each page of the memoir. A study by psychologists
          Piotr Winkielman and Yekaterina Gogolushko on the "Influence of
          Suboptimally and Optimally Presented Affective Pictures and Words on
          Consumption-Related Behavior" reveals that a single image elicits a
          stronger emotional response than a single word. Additionally, whether
          a memoir is illustrated in black and white may reveal much about the
          work versus colored content. The author's background including race,
          age, nationality, gender, and any other personal information is also
          crucial to understanding the motivations behind their memoir.
          Furthermore, the publication date of a graphic memoir is important
          because society also plays a major influence on the content that is
          released, especially if there is greater emphasis on a particular
          current event or the author's past. Through statistical analysis of
          these features I can gain a greater context of the features that allow
          Satrapi's work to be such an effective medium for political and social
          protest.

          Object Detection for Counting Panels
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          Using traditional object detection algorithms and appropriate shape
          thresholding it is possible to get an accurate count of the average
          number of panels per page in a given chapter of Satrapi's work.
          Through observing the number of panels per page, the reader can
          understand the author's predominant style of closure: scene-to-scene
          which involves a series of events that happen in one location, and
          continuous period of time revolving around Satrapi's life. In this
          particular sample page below we can observe the results of the object
          detection algorithm. In this specific case, the algorithm detects 6
          panels denoted by the green outlines in the right-most image:

        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          Furthermore, digging deeper into the distribution of chapters versus
          the average number of panels per page one can see that Satrapi
          typically does not use more than seven panels on average per page.
          With this information, one can use the average number of panels per
          page to compare different memoirs.

          Chapter vs Average Number of Words Per Page
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          Moving on to the average number of words per page, due to the nature
          of <i>The Complete Persepolis</i> being a graphic memoir, it is much less
          dense in terms of average word (at most 200 words) count per page compared
          to novels which typically average to much more. The statistic of average
          number of words per page can be used to contrast the writing styles of
          different authors in graphic memoirs and weigh the advantages and disadvantages
          of denser texts. A highly debated topic in literature is finding this optimal
          word-count balance.

          Words Frequencies
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          The frequency of certain words in a graphic memoir can also reveal
          more about the theme of a particular memoir. In the case of Satrapi's <i
            >The Complete Persepolis</i
          >, below is a visualization (word cloud) of the most common words in
          the entire memoir along with an accompanying table:
        </p>
        <img src="word_cloud.png" alt="Word Cloud" />
        <FreqTable />
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          As seen in the table above, among the most common words is "know". The
          word "know" may appear frequently because it shows Satrapi's continual
          quest for knowledge of the world around her through her childhood in
          Iran, teenage years in Austria, and early adulthood in Iran. Arguably,
          this statistic reveals Satrapi's focus on knowledge acquired through
          scholarship but rather interpersonal transmission of knowledge with
          family, friends, and acquaintances. These relationships lead Satrapi
          to develop a knack for social and political activism in order to
          inform individuals with stereotypical and disillusioned perspectives
          of her Iranian nationality. This raises the ultimate question if the
          knowledge we gain from other people is as reliable as the research we
          conduct. The broader implications of Satrapi's concept of social
          disillusionment through her encounters with the global community while
          in school at Austria can be related to the effects of social media
          today and false narratives surrounding demographics of people.

          Chapter vs Word to Image Ratio
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          A highly discussed topic introduced by Scott McCloud in the chapter
          "Show and Tell" of his work, <i
            >Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</i
          > is finding the "perfect" balance between words and images. According
          to McCloud the norm in literature is that great works of art and literature
          are only possible when the words and images are kept separate. In Scott's
          perspective, people are often taught with picture books as children because
          they are "easier" and less nuanced than the more "real" novels read as
          adults. However, the art of comics is finding the right balance of words
          and images. Specifically, Satrapi's memoir utilizes a word and picture
          combination known as interdependent which involves that words and pictures
          go hand in hand to convey an idea that neither could convey alone. The
          graph below shows the word to image ratios in every chapter of Marjane
          Satrapi's graphic memoir, <i>The Complete Persepolis</i>. For
          reference, the higher the word to image ratio, the greater the number
          of words relative to images there are. By using statistical analysis
          and machine learning techniques, it is possible to compare the
          interaction between words and images to study the ratio of each and
          their relative effectiveness as graphic memoirs.

          Colors Present in Memoir
        </h1>
        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          Another, undervalued property of graphic memoirs is their color
          palette. Scott McCloud describes the effect of color in the chapter "A
          Word About Color" of his work, <i
            >Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</i
          >. According to McCloud, while color gives the author more ability to
          explore with the expression of their images and allows authors to
          "objectify their subjects" (189), "unfortunately, color is still an
          expensive option and has historically been in the hands of larger,
          more conservative publishers" (191). This leads to most comic artists
          to be forced to experiment with shades of black and white. As
          explained by McCloud, "the differences between balck-and-white and
          color comics are vast and profound affecting every level of the
          reading experience." (192) McCloud states that in "black and white,
          the ideas behind the art are communicated more directly [where]
          meaning transcends form [and] art approaches language." (192)
          Furthermore, McCloud states that flat colors "take on more
          significance...and through more expressive colors comics can become an
          intoxicating environment of sensations that only color can give."
          (192) Thus, color plays an important role in the meaning of graphic
          memoirs, however, cost can be prohibitive. This could be a potential
          reason Satrapi uses a black and white color palette as well as to
          communicate a more direct meaning of her work:

        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          One interesting statistic to explore is the sentiment of a graphic
          memoir. Using state of the art language models it is possible to
          identify the connotation and tone of pages in a graphic memoir. As a
          good starting point, we can place the concept of sentiment into three
          broad categories: negative, neutral, and positive. Linguistically
          speaking, it can be possible to create datasets that roughly map
          common English words and their meaning to these categories. In the
          case of Marjane's work, it is not surprising to see that the majority
          of pages are detected as negative because the graphic memoir is
          centered around the difficulty of her life with the Iranian Revolution
          of 1979, Iran-Iraq War, separation from her family, loss of loved
          ones, and other trauma. However, this method is still lacking in
          understanding the nuance of combinations of multiple sentiments being
          expressed in a page. While it is possible to take the ratio of
          positive, neutral, and negative to aggregate a statistic of each it
          leads to difficulty in effectively communicating my analysis. Hence,
          sentiment as a comparison metric of different memoirs has the
          potential to be further explored in future works. A graph of the
          highest sentiment score for each page of the memoir can be visualized
          in the bar graph below:

          AI Generated Text Using GPT2
        </h1>

        <p class="indent-8 leading-8">
          As a final experiment, the capabilities of generative AI are explored
          through a transfer learning application on a LLM architecture known as
          GPT2 (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer). The model was fine-tuned
          (trained) on Satrapi's memoir and then tasked with sentence-completion
          of similar style text to her memoir. An example of the results are
          shown below. In this example, it can be seen that there are generally
          inconsistencies in the AI-generated text such as repetitive statements
          and logical fallacies. Through this initial case study, generative AI
          is still a long way from effectively and convincingly generating text.
          In fact, the simplest case of the algorithm involves probabilistically
          generating text based on the context of previous words (tokens) in the
          text. In most cases, similar types of algorithms are found to
          regurgitate information trained on rather than generating unique
          information.

            preconceptions by the Western reader through the weight of words and
            the representational burden of images. Through the context of Stromberg's
            work, I will gain a greater understanding of the global impact of Satrapi's
            work and connect it to my overarching analysis of what makes her memoir
            so emotionally compelling. (131 words)

            This study measures the impact of two of the most common emotional
            stimuli, images and words. According to their research, a single
            picture has the power to sway people while a single word does not.
            The genre of this source falls under the background source category
            of BEAT. The goal of including the scientists' work is to provide
            additional context to the statistical analysis I will be attempting
            on Marjane Satrapi's <i>The Complete Persepolis</i>, specifically,
            measuring the average ratio of words to images per page. My
            conclusion will help me understand if it is the images that create
            the most significant emotional impact in the memoir or if the words
            provide an additive effect. (114 words)
